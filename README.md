## What is Data Visualization ? 

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

Visualization is central to advanced analytics. When a data scientist is writing advanced predictive analytics or machine learning (ML) algorithms, it becomes important to visualize the outputs to monitor results and ensure that models are performing as intended. This is because visualizations of complex algorithms are generally easier to interpret than numerical outputs.

## Why is data visualization important?
Data visualization provides a quick and effective way to communicate information in a universal manner using visual information. The practice can also help businesses identify which factors affect customer behavior; pinpoint areas that need to be improved or need more attention; make data more memorable for stakeholders; understand when and where to place specific products; and predict sales volumes.

## Other benefits of data visualization include the following:

* the ability to absorb information quickly, improve insights and make faster decisions
* an increased understanding of the next steps that must be taken to improve the organization
* an improved ability to maintain the audience's interest with information they can understand
* an easy distribution of information that increases the opportunity to share insights with everyone involved
* eliminate the need for data scientists since data is more accessible and understandable, and
* an increased ability to act on findings quickly and, therefore, achieve success with greater speed and less mistakes.
